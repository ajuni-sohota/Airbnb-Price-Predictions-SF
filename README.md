# Airbnb Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict rental property prices on Airbnb using machine learning techniques. The dataset comprises various features related to rental properties such as location, amenities, property type, and other attributes. The primary objective is to build a robust predictive model to estimate rental prices accurately.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a reliable machine learning model that predicts rental prices for Airbnb properties based on multiple features. Through thorough data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, the aim is to create a model capable of making accurate price predictions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn

## Steps

### 1. Data Collection and Exploration
- Gather the dataset containing information on Airbnb rental properties.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, features, and distributions.
- Address missing values, perform data cleaning, and handle outliers if necessary.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Prepare the data for model training by encoding categorical variables and performing feature scaling.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 3. Model Building
- Implement a baseline XGBoost model without hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

### 4. Fine-tuning the Model
- Utilize GridSearchCV or other hyperparameter optimization techniques to fine-tune the XGBoost model.
- Train the XGBoost model with the best parameters obtained from the hyperparameter tuning process.
- Assess the model's performance on the test set and calculate the evaluation metrics.

### 5. Feature Importance Analysis
- Determine the feature importance scores using the trained XGBoost model.
- Visualize the feature importance scores through appropriate plots or tables.
- Identify the most influential features contributing to the pricing predictions.

## Conclusion
Summarize the project's outcomes, highlighting the model's performance, key insights obtained from feature analysis, and potential areas for further improvement. Discuss the significance of the predictive model in the context of predicting Airbnb rental prices.
